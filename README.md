# ADCS Simulation

A lightweight attitude dynamics and control simulation designed for CubeSats. It simulates quaternion-based attitude error feedback using reaction wheels and is built with modularity and simplicity in mind.

---

## Compatibility

This simulation is tested and compatible with the following:

- **Simulink**: R2024b or newer

Other versions may work but are not deffinetlly.

---

## Features

- Quaternion-based attitude error calculation
- Reaction wheel control using PD logic
- Handles full 3D rotation and coupled axis behavior
- Uses quaternion math without normalization artifacts
- Error vector extracted from quaternion difference using quaternion multiplication

---

## Topics

- Satellite Attitude Dynamics
- Quaternion Error Feedback
- PD Control for Reaction Wheels

---

## Future Work

- [ ] **Parameterization** of physical properties like:
  - Reaction wheel inertia
  - Maximum RPM and torque
- [ ] **Integration of angular velocity (`W`) to quaternion (`q`)**
- [ ] Configurable control gains and saturation limits via scripts

## Ask Me About...

If you're confused about how any part of the simulation worksâ€”especially quaternion handling, controller tuning, or reaction wheel modelingâ€”just reach out! Iâ€™m always happy to help clarify the math or the code structure.
